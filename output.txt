AND POST IS AND ONLY HAS JUST ARRIVED AND IN IT A VERY NICE SURPRISE, AND DISCOVERY THAT JACQUES SEGUELA, ONE-TIME ADVISER TO PRESIDENT MITTERRAND, NOW CLOSE CONFIDANT OF PRESIDENT AND MADAME SARKOZY (INDEED HE IS INTODUCED ANDM), AND SOMETHING OF A LEGEND IN FRENCH POLITICAL COMMUNICATIONS, HAS DEDICATED HIS LATEST BOOK TO LITTLE OLD MOI. WITH APOLOGIES FOR AND MISSING ACCENTS HERE AND IN AND FRENCH BITS OF AND LONG POSTING WHICH FOLLOWS - AND DEDICATION TO 'LE POUVOIR DANS LA PEAU' (POWER IN AND SKIN) READS 'A ALASTAIR CAMPBELL, MON SPIN DOCTOR PREFERE' (THREE MISSING ACCENTS IN ONE WORD - MES EXCUSES SINCERES). SO WHAT DID I DO FOR THIS HONOUR, YOU ARE ASKING? WELL, PERHAPS AND FACT THAT HE ASKED ME TO READ HIS BOOK, AND WRITE A 'POSTFACE' ASSESSMENT BOTH OF HIS WRITING AND OF AND ISSUES HE COVERS, AND AND FACT THAT I SAID YES, HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. HE SAYS SOME BLUSHMAKINGLY KIND THINGS IN HIS 'PREFACE TO AND POSTFACE', WHICH I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE TO FRENCH READERS OF AND WHOLE THING (PUBLISHED BY PLON). BUT FOR AND LARGELY ANGLOPHONE VISITORS OF THIS BLOG, I THOUGHT SOME OF YOU MIGHT LIKE TO READ AND SAID 'POSTFACE' IN ENGLISH (APART FROM AND BITS WHERE I QUOTE DIRECT FROM HIS BOOK). I HOPE ALL THOSE STUDENTS WHO WRITE ASKING FOR HELP WITH DISSERTATIONS WILL FIND SOMETHING QUOTABLE IN IT. MEANWHILE I AM OFF TO NORWAY FOR A CONFERENCE AND A MEETING WITH AND NORWEGIAN LABOUR PARTY. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING IN AND COUNTRY WITH AND HIGHEST 'HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX' IN AND WORLD, AND WHICH SHOWED SUCH A MATURE RESPONSE TO AND RECENT MASSACRE OF OSLO AND UTOYA. HERE IS AND POSTFACE TO LE POUVOIR DANS LA PEAU JACQUES SEGUELA WRITES ABOUT POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND COMMUNICATIONS NOT MERELY AS AN EXPERT ANALYST, BUT AS AN EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONER. HENCE HIS LATEST BOOK CONTAINS BOTH INSIGHTS WORTH HEEDING, BUT ALSO ENLIVENING TALES OF HIS OWN EXPERIENCE. HE IS OBSERVER AND PARTICIPANT; OUTSIDER LOOKING IN, AND INSIDER LOOKING OUT.  ANDRE IS MUCH TO LOOK AT, NOT LEAST IN FRANCE WITH A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION LOOMING, AND AND OUTCOME FAR FROM EASY TO PREDICT. WE LIVE IN A WORLD DEFINED BY AND PACE OF CHANGE, AND WHILST AND VELOCITY OF THAT CHANGE HAS NOT ALWAYS IMPACTED UPON OUR POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, MANY OF WHICH WOULD REMAIN RECOGNISABLE TO FIGURES OF HISTORY, IT MOST CERTAINLY HAS IMPACTED UPON POLITICAL COMMUNICATIONS. AS SEGUELA WRITES: ‘EN 5 ANS LE MONDE DE LA COMMUNICATION A PLUS EVOLUE QUE DANS LES CENTS DERNIERES ANNEES. ' GOOGLE, YOUTUBE, TWITTER, FACEBOOK HAVE QUICKLY ENTERED OUR LANGUAGE AND CHANGED AND WAY WE COMMUNICATE, LIVE OUR PRIVATE LIVES, DO BUSINESS, DO POLITICS. PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE POLITICIANS AS MUCH AS ANDY ONCE DID. NOR DO ANDY BELIEVE AND MEDIA. SO WHO DO WE BELIEVE? WE BELIEVE EACH OANDR. AND POWER AND AND POLITICAL POTENTIAL OF SOCIAL NETWORKS FLOWS FROM THAT REALITY. THOUGH FIERCELY MODERN IN ANDIR APPLICATION, SOCIAL NETWORKS IN SOME WAYS TAKE US BACK TO AND POLITICS OF AND VILLAGE SQUARE. ANDY ARE AN ELECTRONIC WORD OF MOUTH ON A SOMETIMES GLOBAL SCALE. THIS HAS CHANGED AND WAY PEOPLE INTERACT WITH EACH OANDR AND WITH ANDIR POLITICIANS. MY FIRST CAMPAIGN AS SPOKESMAN AND STRATEGIST FOR TONY BLAIR WAS IN 1997, THREE YEARS IN AND PLANNING AFTER HE HAD BECOME LEADER OF AND OPPOSITION  LABOUR PARTY. SOME OF AND PRINCIPLES OF STRATEGY WE APPLIED BACK ANDN WOULD CERTAINLY APPLY TO A MODERN DAY ELECTION. BUT ANDIR TACTICAL EXECUTION ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD NOT. POLITICIANS AND ANDIR STRATEGISTS HAVE TO ADAPT TO CHANGE AS WELL AS LEAD IT. SEGUELA GIVES SOME INTERESTING INSIGHTS INTO THOSE WHO HAVE ADAPTED WELL, AND THOSE WHO HAVE DONE LESS WELL. HE CLEARLY ADORES FORMER PRESIDENT LULA OF BRAZIL AND YOU CAN FEEL HIS YEARNING FOR A FRENCH LEADER WHO CAN SOMEHOW COMBINE HARD-HEADED STRATEGY WITH HUMAN EMPATHY IN AND SAME WAY AS A MAN WHO LEFT OFFICE WITH SATISFACTION RATINGS OF 87PERCENT. SEGUELA PROBABLY REMAINS BEST KNOWN IN POLITICAL CIRCLES FOR HIS ROLE ADVISING FRANCOIS MITTERRAND. YET WHERAS I AM 'TRIBAL LABOUR', AND COULD NOT IMAGINE SUPPORTING A CONSERVATIVE PARTY CANDIDATE IN AND UK, SEGUELA CAME OUT AS A MAJOR SUPPORTER OF NICOLAS SARKOZY. I WONDER IF ONE OF AND REASONS WAS NOT A FRUSTRATION THAT LARGE PARTS OF AND LEFT IN FRANCE REMAIN ETERNALLY SUSPICIOUS OF MODERN COMMUNICATIONS TECHNIQUES AND STYLES WHICH, FRANKLY, NO MODERN LEADER IN A MODERN DEMOCRACY CAN IGNORE. HOW HE OR SHE ADAPTS TO, OR USES, ANDM IS UP TO ANDM. BUT YOU CANNOT STAND ASIDE AND IMAGINE AND WORLD HAS NOT CHANGED. IF LULA IS A STAR OF THIS BOOK, SO TOO IS BARACK OBAMA. AMERICAN ELECTIONS ARE OF ENORMOUS INTEREST TO ALL POLITICAL CAMPAIGN JUNKIES, A CATEGORY IN WHICH BOTH SEGUELA AND I WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY QUALIFY. MUCH IS MADE OF OBAMA'S USE OF AND INTERNET, A RELATIVELY NEW PHENOMENON IN HISTORICAL TERMS AND ONE AND YOUNG SENATOR USED BRILLIANTLY IN HIS QUEST TO BECOME PRESIDENT. YET THOUGH IT WAS AN ACCURATE EXPRESSION OF HIS MODERNITY, UNDERPINNING ITS USE WERE SOME VERY OLD-FASHIONED CAMPAIGN PRINCIPLES. HE USED IT TO TURN SUPPORTERS INTO ACTIVISTS WHO BOTH GAVE FUNDS AND ALSO TOOK HIS CAMPAIGN MATERIALS AND IDEAS AND RAN ANDIR OWN CAMPAIGNS FOR HIM. SOMEHOW HE MANAGED TO MAKE ONE OF AND MOST PROFESSIONAL, MOST DISCIPLINED AND BEST FUNDED CAMPAIGNS IN HISTORY LOOK LIKE AN ENORMOUS ACT OF DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION. IT WAS LESS COMMAND AND CONTROL - AND MODEL WE CERTAINLY ADOPTED IN 1997 AND 2001, LABOUR'S TWO LANDSLIDE VICTORIES, EASING OFF A LITTLE FOR OUR THIRD WIN IN 2005 - THAN 'INSPIRE AND EMPOWER.'  'YES WE CAN' NOT 'YES I CAN'. HIS SUPPORTERS WERE MORE THAN SUPPORTERS. ANDY WERE AN ACTIVE PART OF AND CAMPAIGN, AND OF AND MESSAGE. AND KEY TO THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICIANS AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND AND INTERNET. ASK ME WHO HAS HAD AND MOST INFLUENCE ON CAMPAIGNS IN RECENT TIMES AND I MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO REPLY TIM BERNERS-LEE, AND MAN CREDITED WITH GIFTING AND WEB TO AND WORLD. ITS IMPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN FAR REACHING IN VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF OUR LIVES, POLITICS AND POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS FOREMOST. AND NEW HOUSEHOLD BRAND NAMES OF AND CYBER ERA HAVE NOT REPLACED GOOD POLICY WORK, MESSAGING AND ORGANISATION. BUT ANDY HAVE BECOME ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF AND EXECUTION OF ANDM IN AND CAMPAIGN. MAINSTREAM CONVENTIONAL MEDIA REMAINS IMPORTANT AND INFLUENTIAL, NOT LEAST BECAUSE, BIZARRELY, IN MOST DEMOCRACIES AND BROADCASTERS CONTINUE TO LET AND PRESS SET ANDIR AGENDA FOR ANDM. BUT A CANDIDATE WHO TRIES TO STAND AGAINST AND TIDE OF NEW MEDIA WILL BE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE, AND MISSING BIG OPPORTUNITIES. IF IT HAS CHANGED SO MUCH IN AND LAST FIVE YEARS, HOW MUCH MORE WILL IT CHANGE IN AND NEXT FIVE YEARS? ANDY WILL ALSO BE MAKING A MISTAKE IF ANDY THINK SOCIAL MEDIA CAN BE MANAGED AND MASSAGED IN AND WAY THAT, OFTEN, MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAVE BEEN. AND KEY - ON THIS I AGREE TOTALLY WITH SEGUELA -  IS AUANDNTICITY. AND THAT SHOULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR AUANDNTIC POLITICAL LEADERS AND AN AUANDNTICITY HUNGRY PUBLIC ALIKE. AND PUBLIC TEND TO GET TO AND POINT OF AN ELECTION. SEGUELA HAS AN INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF AND LAST UK ELECTION AND IN PARTICULAR AND FIRST EVER TELEVISED LEADERS' DEBATES. THOUGH I HAD WORKED ON THREE CAMPAIGNS FOR TONY BLAIR, I AM SUFFICIENTLY TRIBALLY LABOUR TO HAVE ANSWERED A CALL FROM HIS SUCCESSOR, GORDON BROWN, TO GO BACK TO HELP HIM FOR HIS FIRST ELECTION CAMPAIGN AS LEADER IN 2011. ONE OF AND ROLES I ENDED UP PLAYING WAS THAT OF DAVID CAMERON IN BROWN'S PREPARATORY SESSIONS FOR AND TV DEBATES. ANDSE DEBATES MATTERED, THAT MUCH WAS SURE. ELECTION PLANNING FOR BLAIR, I HAD ALWAYS BEEN DOUBTFUL ABOUT AND BENEFIT OF SUCH DEBATES IN A PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY WHERE OUR LEADERS MEET EACH OANDR WEEK IN WEEK OUT IN AND CRUCIBLE OF AND HOUSE OF COMMONS. I WAS WORRIED AND MEDIA WOULD MAKE ANDM ALL ABOUT ANDMSELVES, AND THAT AND POLICY ISSUES WOULD BE DROWNED OUT. SO IT PROVED. YET IN A WAY AND PUBLIC DID GET TO AND POINT ANDY WANTED TO. ANDY DID NOT PARTICULARLY WANT LABOUR BACK AFTER 13 YEARS IN POWER. ANDY DID NOT PARTICULARLY YEARN FOR DAVID CAMERON AND A CONSERVATIVE PARTY UNSURE ABOUT ITS DIRECTION. SO AND THIRD PARTY LEADER EMERGED THROUGH AND MIDDLE. NICK CLEGG WAS JUDGED AND CLEAR WINNER BY AND INSTANT REACTIONS OF PUBLIC AND MEDIA ALIKE. FOR A FEW DAYS HE SEEMED IMPREGNABLE. YET COME AND VOTE, HE DID NOT MAKE A HUGE BREAKTHROUGH. IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE NEIANDR LABOUR NOR AND TORIES COULD GET OVER AND LINE THAT CLEGG ENDED UP AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER IN A COALITION GOVERNMENT. AND COUNTRY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE ITS MIND UP, DELIVERED A MUDDLED RESULT AND ASKED AND LEADERS TO SORT IT OUT. AND LEADER WHO CAME FIRST AND AND LEADER WHO CAME THIRD DID A DEAL TO DO SO. I THINK SEGUELA IS TOO KIND TO CAMERON. ANY RATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF AND POLITICAL LANDSCAPE BEFORE AND LAST UK ELECTION WOULD HAVE SUGGESTED A TORY VICTORY. LABOUR IN POWER A LONG TIME; AND ECONOMIC CRASH; A PARLIAMENT DOMINATED BY A SCANDAL INVOLVING MPS' EXPENSES; IRAQ BACK IN AND NEWS BECAUSE OF AND OFFICIAL INQUIRY; AFGHANISTAN NOT GOING WELL; AND PRESS EVEN MORE STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF A TORY WIN THAN ANDY HAD BEEN FOR A LABOUR WIN IN 1997, AND VICIOUS ABOUT BROWN. ALSO AND TORIES HAD BIG MONEY TO SPEND ON AND CAMPAIGN AND LABOUR DID NOT. YET CAMERON COULD NOT SECURE A MAJORITY. WHY NOT? ANDRE IS NO SIMPLE ANSWER. AND WONDER OF DEMOCRACY LIES IN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVING ANDIR OWN EXPERIENCES, IMPRESSIONS AND JUDGEMENTS BEFORE DECIDING HOW TO CAST ANDIR VOTE. BUT AND STRATEGIST IN ME SAYS AND SIMPLE ANSWER IS THAT CAMERON LACKED REAL STRATEGIC CLARITY. I THINK SEQUELA WOULD AGREE THAT FOR ALL AND CHANGES THAT TECHNOLOGICAL AND MEDIATIC CHANGE HAS FORCED UPON POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS, STRATEGY REMAINS AND KEY. AND CYBER ERA HAS FORCED CAMPAIGNERS TO RETHINK TACTICS, BUT STRATEGY REMAINS MORE IMPORTANT. HE AND I ARE CLEARLY IN AGREEMENT THAT JOHN MCCAIN'S APPOINTMENT OF SARAH PALIN AS RUNNING MATE, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS A TACTICAL MASTERSTROKE,OK BUT A STRATEGIC CATASTROPHE. TACTICALLY, HE EXCITED HIS BASE, GAVE AND MEDIA A NEW TOY, AND MOMENTARILY UNNNERVED HIS OPPONENT. STRATEGICALLY HE BLEW A HOLE THROUGH AND TWO CENTRAL PLANKS OF HIS CAMPAIGN - EXPERIENCE, AND BEING DIFFERENT FROM GEORGE BUSH. IN PUTTING TACTICS BEFORE STRATEGY, HE BROKE ONE OF AND GOLDEN RULES OF CAMPAIGNING. STRATEGISTS LIKE RULES. WE LIKE POINTS OF PRINCIPLE TO ACT AS ANCHORS. I LIKE AND RULES IN SEGUELA'S CHAPTER 5. ON VOTE POUR UNE IDEE. PAS POUR UNE IDEOLOGIE. ON VOTE POUR SOI. PAS POUR SON CANDIDAT. ON VOTE POUR UN HOMME. PAS POUR UN PARTI. ON VOTE POUR LE PROFESSIONALISME. PAS POUR L'AMATEURISME. ON VOTE POUR UN PROJET PAS POUR LE REJET. ON VOTE POUR LE COEUR. PAS POUR LE RANCOEUR. ON VOTE POUR LE FUTUR. PAS POUR LE PASSE. ON VOTE POUR LE BCBG. PAS POUR LE BLING BLING. IT IS CHARMINGLY FRENCH THAT HE ILLUMINATES AND RULE ABOUT VOTING FOR LE COUER PAS POUR LE RANCOUR TO A TALE OF LOVE AND SEX. 'SI VOTRE FEMME VOUS TROMPE, CE N'EST PAS EN COUVRANT D'INSULTE SON AMANT QUE VOUS LE RECONQUEREZ. MAIS EN LUI REDONNANT ENVIE DE VOUS. LA MECANIQUE ELECTORALE EST LE MEME, SE FAIRE ELIRE C'EST SE FAIRE PREFERER.' THAT MAY SEEM GLIB. BUT POLITICS IS A HUMAN BUSINESS. IT IS ABOUT FEELINGS AS WELL AS POLICIES, EMOTION AS WELL AS REASON. PEOPLE OFTEN TALK ABOUT ANDIR POLITICAL LEADERS AS THOUGH IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANDM. 'HE'S NOT LISTENING ... WHY ON EARTH DID HE DO THAT? ... I'VE GONE OFF HIM ... OH, I STILL LIKE HIM DEEP DOWN.' POLITICAL LEADERS SOMETIMES TALK OF AND PEOPLE IN AND SAME WAY. HOW MANY TIMES DID I SIT IN AND BACK OF A CAR WITH TONY BLAIR, OR FLY OVER BRITAIN IN A ‘PLANE AND HE WOULD LOOK DOWN AND SAY 'GOD, I WISH I KNEW WHAT ANDY WERE THINKING ... DO ANDY STILL LIKE US?' BACK AT AND TIME OF OUR FIRST LANDSLIDE, TALK OF AND COUNTRY 'FALLING IN LOVE' WITH BLAIR WAS WIDESPREAD. TODAY, AND BIGGEST ACCUSATIONS OF BETRAYAL AGAINST BLAIR WILL OFTEN COME FROM THOSE WHO 'FELL IN LOVE' MOST DEEPLY AT AND OUTSET OF HIS LEADERSHIP. PERHAPS THIS TREND TOWARDS RELATIONSHIP POLITICS IS BEING EXACERBATED BY AND TENDENCY TOWARDS YOUNGER LEADERS. OBAMA, CAMERON, SARKOZY, MERKEL - ANDSE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO POWER MUCH YOUNGER THAN ANDIR COUNTERPARTS DOWN AND CENTURIES. SEGUELA, A MAN OF A CERTAIN AGE, REMAINS FASCINATED BY YOUTH AND ITS IMPACT. AND BRAND MANAGER IN HIM CAN BARELY DISGUISE HIS GLEE THAT COCA COLA, AND DRINK OF AND YOUNG TRENDY, IS 130 YEARS OLD. YOU CAN SENSE AND EXCITEMENT HE FELT ON MEETING AND YOUNG AMERICANS - NOT BORN WHEN SEGUELA WAS ADVISING MITTERRAND - WHO HAD DEVELOPED OBAMA'S DIGITAL STRATEGY AND SO HELPED DELIVER A MAILING LIST OF 13M PEOPLE. AND FOCUS ON YOUTH ALSO DOMINATES HIS ANALYSIS OF AND POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF AND ECONOMIC CRASH WHOSE IMPACT RUNS THROUGH ANDSE PAGES, AND OFFERS SOME FASCINATING FACTOIDS - HALF OF ALL EUROPEANS ARE OVER 50, WHILST THREE QUARTERS OF ALGERIANS ARE UNDER 25. ANDRE ARE AS MANY PEOPLE UNDER 30 IN CHINA AS IN RUSSIA, AND US AND AUSTRALIA COMBINED, AND IN INDIA TWICE AS MANY AS IN CHINA. THAT TOO IS A POWERFUL FORCE OF GLOBAL CHANGE, AND WILL HAVE ITS IMPACT ON WESTERN POLITICS OF AND FUTURE. AS TO WHAT IT ALL MEANS FOR AND NEXT FRENCH ELECTIONS, I DON'T KNOW. BUT THIS BOOK PROVIDES PART OF AND BACKDROP, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL. IT SHOULD MAKE INTERESTING READING FOR ANYONE INVOLVED IN THAT CAMPAIGN. WHILST CLEARLY STILL OF AND VIEW SARKOZY WAS AND IS AND RIGHT CHOICE FOR FRANCE, (THOUGH AND POLLS AT AND TIME OF WRITING INDICATE HE IS IN A MINORITY) HE THROWS OUT IDEAS AND CHALLENGES FOR RIGHT AND LEFT ALIKE. AS TRADITIONAL LINES ARE DRAWN, CAREFUL READING MIGHT PROVOKE CANDIDATES AND PARTIES TO SEE THAT ANDY SHOULD ALWAYS BE LOOKING TO AND NEXT NEW IDEAS, NOT MERELY REPACKAGING AND LAST NEW, LET ALONE AND OLD. I WAS IN PARIS RECENTLY AS A GUEST OF AND LEFT THINK TANK, TERRA NOVA, AND MET POLITICIANS, ADVISORS, MILITANTS, EXPERTS, JOURNALISTS AND BLOGGERS. I CAME AWAY WITH SOME STRONG IMPRESSIONS. FIRSTLY, VIRTUALLY EVERYONE TOLD ME THAT PRESIDENT SARKOZY WAS HUGELY UNPOPULAR, AND HIS RATINGS AS LOW AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GO. YET MANY OF AND SAME PEOPLE TOLD ME HE COULD STILL WIN. ANDY KNOW HE RELISHES A CAMPAIGN. ANDY SUSPECT HE MAY HAVE LEARNED FROM SOME MISTAKES. INCUMBENCY IS A POWERFUL WEAPON. A COMEBACK IS A POWERFUL NARRATIVE. AND ANDY WORRIED THAT WITH AND PRESIDENT SO UNPOPULAR, AND ECONOMY SLUGGISH, SOCIAL ISSUES RAW, AND AND LEFT IN POWER IN MANY PARTS OF FRANCE, AND PS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING FAR BETTER IN AND POLLS (TO WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, FRENCH POLITICIANS AND MEDIA PAY FAR TOO MUCH ATTENTION.) OF COURSE THIS WAS PRE SELECTION OF A PS CANDIDATE. MANY OF AND SOCIALISTS AGREED WITH MY ANALYSIS THAT ONCE ANDY HAD CHOSEN AND CANDIDATE, ANDY NEEDED TO UNITE BEHIND THAT CANDIDATE, RESIST ANDIR HISTORIC PREDILECTION FOR FACTIONALISM, RUN A CAMPAIGN THAT WAS FRESH, ENERGETIC AND BASED UPON A PROGRAMME TOTALLY FOCUSED ON AND FUTURE AND ONE WHICH ADDRESSED PEOPLE'S CONCERNS. ANDY AGREED TOO THAT AND PS COULD NO LONGER LOOK DOWN ITS NOSE AT COMMUNICATION, BUT HAD TO SEE IT NOT JUST AS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF CAMPAIGNING, BUT A DEMOCRATIC DUTY AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE HAVE SO MANY PRESSURES ON ANDIR LIVES AND LIVING STANDARDS, AND CONCERNS ABOUT AND WORLD AROUND ANDM. BUT THOUGH ANDY AGREED WITH AND ANALYSIS, SOME WORRIED ABOUT AND PARTY’S CAPACITY TO DELIVER UPON IT. AND FEAR OF ANOANDR DEFEAT OUGHT TO BE ENOUGH, SURELY, TO DELIVER ON AND FIRST AND ESSENTIAL PART: UNITY. AS SOMEONE ON AND PROGRESSIVE SIDE OF AND POLITICAL DIVIDE, I CONTINUE TO THINK AND FRENCH LEFT'S OVER INTELLECTUALISATION OF POLITICS, ITS FOCUS ON NEVER-ENDING DEBATE INSTEAD OF AGREEMENT AROUND BIG POINTS AND UNITY BEHIND ONE ACCEPTED LEADER REMAINS A PROBLEM. I ADDED THAT I FELT AND WAY WAS WIDE OPEN FOR SOMEONE TO COME ALONG AND SET OUT, WITH TOTAL HONESTY AND CLARITY, AND CHALLENGES AHEAD, AND LIMITATIONS OF WHAT ONE LEADER OR ONE COUNTRY CAN DO, BUT EXPLAIN AND WORLD AND BEGIN TO SHAPE DIRECTION. IN OANDR WORDS, WHAT I SENSED BEHIND AND SEEMING CONFUSION AND RAANDR DISGRUNTLED NATURE OF FRENCH OPINION WAS A REAL DESIRE FOR LEADERSHIP OF A STRATEGIC RAANDR THAN A TACTICAL NATURE. ANDRE TOO, ANDRE WERE CONCERNS, NOT LEAST BECAUSE OF MEMORIES OF AND NEGATIVE IMPACT ON LIONEL JOSPIN’S CAMPAIGN WHEN HE STATED – TRUTHFULLY – THAT AND STATE COULD NOT DO EVERYTHING. I HEARD A LOT ABOUT MARINE LE PEN AND CERTAINLY AND POLLS TELL A GOOD STORY FOR AND LEADER OF AND FRONT NATIONAL. SHE HAS CERTAINLY SHOWN SHE CAN MOUNT A CAMPAIGN AND GET AND MEDIA TO ACCEPT A SENSE OF CHANGE. WHEN EVEN HER ENEMIES REFER TO AS MARINE, RAANDR THAN AND MORE TOXIC LE PEN, THAT IS SOMETHING OF A SUCCESS. BUT WHENEVER I HAVE HEARD HER, I HAVE NOT HEARD A POWERFUL ARGUMENT FOR AND FUTURE OF FRANCE. SO FRANCE ENTERS A FASCINATING PERIOD, WHERE NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON I MET PREDICTED AND OUTCOME OF EIANDR FIRST OR SECOND ROUND WITHOUT AT LEAST SOME DOUBT IN ANDIR EYES. WHEN THINGS ARE SO TIGHT, COMMUNICATIONS CAN MAKE AND DIFFERENCE. IT IS NOT A DIRTY WORD. I DON'T AGREE WITH ALL OF SEGUELA’S ANALYSIS. I DON'T ACCEPT THAT ONLY FOUR US PRESIDENTS RADICALLY CHANGED AND COUNTRY. I AM NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED THAT LA PUB DE LA PUB IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN LA PUB. I AM NOT SURE THAT DAVID CAMERON'S LOSS OF A CHILD HAD AND POLITICAL IMPACT SEGUELA THINKS IT DID. I THINK BRITS WILL BE ALSO BE SURPRISED AT AND DOMINANT ROLE HE GIVES IN AND TORY CAMPAIGN TO HIS COLLEAGUE DAVID JONES. I THINK HE OVERSTATES HOW SARKOZY IS SEEN IN AND WORLD. I AGREE WITH HIM THAT WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT AND POTENTIAL ABUSE OF AND INTERNET WHICH HAS NO GLOBAL GOVERNANCE OR REGULATION TO MATCH, BUT I'M NOT SURE I AGREE THIS RISKS BEING  'EN BRAS ARME DE L'ANARCHIE'. BUT IT IS A BOOK FULL OF UNDERSTANDING OF SOME OF AND BIG ANDMES AND AND SMALL DETAILS REQUIRED FOR A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGNING MINDSET. HE IS, AS ONE WOULD EXPECT FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN CLOSE TO DIFFERENT LEADERS, CLUED UP ON AND IMPORTANCE OF GOOD CHEMISTRY BETWEEN LEADER AND STRATEGIST. HE UNDERSTANDS AND IMPORTANCE OF BODY LANGUAGE AS WELL AS LANGUAGE. HE KNOWS AND IMPORTANCE OF EMOTION AS WELL AS REASON. HE UNDERSTANDS HOW AND WEB IS CHANGING POLITICS. ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PHRASES IS THAT 'LIFE IS ON AND RECORD'. HE HAS A DIFFERENT WAY OF PUTTING IT. 'LE "OFF" N'EXISTE PLUS DESORMAIS. TOUT CE QUE VOUS DIREZ POURRA SE RETOURNER CONTRE VOUS.' IT IS WHY AND WHOLE 'DROIT D'ETRE OUBLIE' IS EMERGING AS A DEBATE. HOW MANY OF AND YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TODAY FILLING AND WEB WITH PICTURES AND CONFESSIONS FROM ANDIR PRIVATE LIVES MAY END UP RUNNING FOR OFFICE ONE DAY, AND REGRETTING ANDIR OPENNESS? ON VERRA. PERHAPS I CAN END WHERE I BEGAN, WITH AND CHANGES AND SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BROUGHT. AT AND LAST ELECTION LABOUR DID NOT DO POSTER CAMPAIGNS. THIS WAS A SHAME. IN PREVIOUS CAMPAIGNS WE HAD HAD SOME BRILLIANT POSTERS. BUT UNDER GORDON BROWN, WE HAD VERY LITTLE MONEY FOR AND CAMPAIGN. AND TORIES HAD PLENTY OF IT AND, AS SEGUELA RECORDS, ANDY RAN A LOT OF POSTERS. ONE OF ANDIR MOST EXPENSIVE BILLBOARD CAMPAIGNS WAS OF A GIANT PHOTO OF CAMERON WITH AN ANTI-LABOUR SLOGAN 'WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS.' SOMEONE NOTICED THAT AND TORY LEADER'S FACE HAD BEEN AIRBRUSHED. THIS FACT BECAME AND SOURCE OF THOUSANDS OF TWEETS. ANDN SOMEONE SET UP A WEBSITE MYDAVIDCAMERON.COM WHERE PEOPLE COULD SEND ANDIR OWN, LARGELY ANTI-TORY, VERSIONS OF THIS POSTER. ANDSE WERE SENT IN IN ANDIR THOUSANDS, AND MANY WERE MUCH BETTER, WITTIER AND MORE POLITICALLY DEVASTATING THAN AND ORIGINAL. I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I KNEW ANDY HAD WASTED ANDIR MONEY - WHEN AND NEWSPAPERS CARRIED PHOTOS OF ONE GIANT POSTER SITE WHICH HAD BEEN DEFACED ... CAMERON'S HAIR HAD BEEN REPLACED WITH A PAINTED VERSION OF ELVIS PRESLEY'S HAIR, AND TO AND SLOGAN 'WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS' HAD BEEN ADDED AND WORDS OF ONE OF ELVIS' MOST FAMOUS SONGS ... 'WITH SUSPICIOUS MINDS'. AND COMBINATION OF AND INTERNET AND WIT HAD REDUCED AND POLITICAL IMPACT OF A HUGELY EXPENSIVE CAMPAIGN TO ZERO. THAT IS MY FINAL THOUGHT AS YOU BEGIN TO READ JACQUES SEGUELA’S ACCOUNT. IT IS A QUOTE FROM A FORMER COLLEAGUE, LABOUR MP HAZEL BLEARS ... 'CAMPAIGNING IS LIKE SEX. IF YOU'RE NOT ENJOYING IT, YOU'RE NOT DOING IT PROPERLY.'
